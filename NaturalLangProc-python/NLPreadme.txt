Greetings Guys!!
This is Sridhar writing a few scripts in python for Natural Language Processing
The package which I have used is nltk
Download nltk using either pip or easy_install
	Command: pip install nltk
All the packages will NOT BE Installed on the first go!!
Use the following command!!
	nltk.download('all')
This may take several minutes too.
